\chapter*{Preface}

These lecture notes grew out of a series of lectures for the course
MATH 5001: Computational Optimization taught at Missouri University
of Science and Technology (formerly University of Missouri, Rolla)
during Spring 2026.

These notes present a mixture of several topics, including optimization,
machine learning, and computation, with a primary focus on optimization.

We thank the participating students: Stanislav Butkovich, 
Erich Gozebina, Qitong Huang, Nikunj Pradhan, and Mohammed Sleiman.

We also thank our Interim Chair Professor John Singler of the Mathematics \& Statistics Department for his support of the course.
